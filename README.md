# Generalized-Dicke-States

An implementation to prepare generalized Dicke states based on qubits.

The algorithm was developed in "Reducing the Number of Qubits in Solving LWE" by B. J. Benedikt (PQCrypto 2025).

The file "prepare-dicke.ipynb" contains the implementation of the algorithms and an example how to use the algorithms. This file requires the packages Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/install), Qiskit (https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html) and Numpy (https://numpy.org/install/).
