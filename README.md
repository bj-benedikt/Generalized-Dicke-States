# Generalized-Dicke-States

An implementation to prepare generalized Dicke states based on qubits.

The algorithm was developed in "Dicke States: How to Generalize, Prepare and Apply" by B. J. Benedikt (unpublished, in submission).

The file "dicke.ipynb" contains the implementation of the algorithms and an example how to use the algorithms. This file requires the packages Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/install), Qiskit (https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html) and Numpy (https://numpy.org/install/).
